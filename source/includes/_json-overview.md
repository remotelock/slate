# JSON Structure Overview

### JSON request structure

The HTTP methods `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` require the header `Content-Type: application/json`
and the request body must contain a valid `JSON` structure.

Other HTTP methods accept empty or missing `Content-Type` header since the request body
is ignored.

Example JSON request structure:

- `POST https://api.remotelock.com/articles/3/comments`

      {
        "attributes": {
          "body": "Very informative article"
        }
      }

### JSON response structure

- All responses have `data` root key. `data` object keys are `id`, `type`,
  `attributes` and `links` (optional).
- `meta` top level key is used for collection pagination.
- Relationship resource URLs can be fetched from the `links` key. A `self` URL
  is also included.
- "1-to-1" relationship object ids are included in the `attributes` object.
  Example: `"author_id": 1` for the author relationship.
- All date and time fields are using ISO 8601 format.
