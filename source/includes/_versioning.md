# API versioning
<br/>

**Specifying API version**

It is strongly recommended to explicitly specify the version. Specifying the
version can be done:

- in the resource `url`

        https://api.remotelock.com/v1/articles/1

- or via request `Accept` header

        Accept: application/vnd.remotelock.v1+json

If API version is not specified, the application will default to the latest
version.

**Changes**

API version will increase only if there's a breaking change.

For example: if a single field is added to the resource, the version won't
change as this is a non breaking change.
